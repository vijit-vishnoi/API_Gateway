FRONTEND - MIDDLE-END - BACKEND

- We need an intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices
- Using this middle end, when client sends request we will be able to make decision that which microservice should actually respond to this request

- We can do manage validation, response transformation, rate limiting
- We try to preapare an API gateway acts as this middle end.
